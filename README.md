# Portfolio-Samples

## Hello

This folder will contain examples of my code used to explore real world data. I will be continuosly adding projects to this repository, using skills in several coding programs such as R, Python, and SQL. I will have my Code posted as well as documents demonstrating my code as needed

#### COVID Project Data
This project is about investigating the CDC's public data on COVID and its affect on the population. This set of data was posted in 2021, it has been updated numerous times since then, so this project will contain the data that was posted at that time.
My main objective right now is exploring the data using SQL and R.

#### Pending Future Project Data
